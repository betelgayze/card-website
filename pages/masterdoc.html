<body>
hello and welcome to the Troll Lore Masterdoc by yours truly! this document is a collection of my fanon for the trolls (both biological and social),
and is written with the assumption that reader is familiar with <b>Homestuck</b>. if not, this might be rather confusing! :'D
<p>let's begin!</p>
<hr>
<p>Main departures from Homestuck canon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slight blood color variation inside the caste is allowed</li>
  <li>Multiple fuchsias are allowed to be alive at the same time (see <a href="#fuchsia">Heiresses</a>)</li>
  <li>Multiple mothergrubs exist per planet</li>
  <li>Lusii can change their blood color (see <a href="#lusii">Lusii</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>General information</h3>
<p>Three grub planets currently exist: Alternia, Carrion and Subportare. Out of the three, Alternia is the most strictly monitored one, with age of departure being 9 sweeps.
Due to it being the cradle of troll race, people from Alternia are believed to be most physically fit, and are, as such, more often conscripted into military positions.
Other two planets, Carrion and Subportare, have an age of departure up to 12 sweeps, with Subportare additionally allow adults in monitored zones for short (up to 36 days) periods of time.
Trolls from these planets, especially lowbloods, are less likely to be conscripted and often find themselves working in other branches of the empire.
all solar systems colonized my Empire have Dyson swarms around their respective suns, which allows virtually unlimited energy and,
as a bonus, regulation of the amount of sunlight that the planet receives. This is used mainly to prolong dawns and dusks on Alternia, and for aid with terraforming on other planets. </p>

<p>Faster-than-light (FTL) communication is achieved through the use of Psyonics, usually from goldbloods. It is used extensively for both military and civillian purposes.</p>
<p>Stripping a troll of their sign is considered a punisment equal to if not worse than death.
The unsigned lose their place in society completely and are legally dead; their cast priviledges are taken away,
 (which for many means a soon and painful death at the hands of lowbloods looking for vengeance),
and they are not seen as valid pailmates, which means their loved ones have no choice but to seek another partner.</p>


<h3>Jadebloods</h3>
<p>Jadebloods present a powerfull political force in the Empire, although their influence is kept secret. Their main way of influence lays in the deep bond with Mothergrubs, and could, in theory,
  use this bond to influence the reproductive proccess. Between jades, a small faction exists of Sufferers disciples, who work to both further his message and save lives of those with mutant blood. </p>
<a id="fuchsia"><h3>Heiresses</h3></a>
<p> An heiress is always present on Alternia, as not having one would mean mass extinction due to Gl'bgolyb's Vast Glub.
  However, in an event that an heiress is prematurely deceased, an immediate replacement is often impossible, as all fuchsiablooded grubs are culled on sight when an heiress has already been chosen
  (barring the last sweep of Heiress' rule, when the most fit one is chosen as an future heiress).
  Due to this, both grub planets have one "replacement heiress". These trolls, hatched on Alternia, are brought to Gl'bgolyb for a time sufficient to form a lusus bond,
  after which they are shipped to their respective planets, where they reside until 12 sweeps old, acting as their planets' rulers. Such a 12 sweep old fuchsia has two ways before them: take a great risk and
  challenge Her Imperious Condescension herself for an almost certain death; or stand before her and profess loyalty to become An Emissary of her will, surrendering their pride.
  Due to trolls' competitive and agressive nature, most choose the first path and die; and those few that surrender often end up dead all the same, as Condescension is cruel in her ways.
  It is important to note that the alternian Heiress does not have a choise of path, as their link with Gl'bgolyb is too dangerous for the Empress to keep them alive.

<a id="lusii"><h3>Lusii</h3></a>
<p>Separation from a lusus that occurs when a troll leaves their grub planet is not
good for either party; this arragement breaks the symbiosis too early even
for lowblood species of lusii and has a negative impat on both mental and physical health of either party. </p>
